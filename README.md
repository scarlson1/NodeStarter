# NodeStarter

Starting project for a course on Advanced Node @ Udemy by Stephen Grider. The course was a couple years old so some of the libraries threw errors with node v16.15.0. I created this version in May 2022. Hopefully it functions similar to the inital template in the course.

The most significant changes from the original template are on the React side (changing to Functional Components). Minimal changes to the server code.

### Additional dependencies

- [final-form & react-final-form](https://final-form.org/docs/react-final-form/getting-started 'Named link title') (~~redux-form~~)
- [http-proxy-middleware](https://github.com/chimurai/http-proxy-middleware 'Named link title')
- [@reduxjs/toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/ 'Named link title')

### Other notes

For the most part, I left the original code from Stephen's course commented out in the file, in case anyone wants to compare the original / debug my code.

There a file called dev.temp.js in the config folder that lists the environment varibles that will need to be added.
